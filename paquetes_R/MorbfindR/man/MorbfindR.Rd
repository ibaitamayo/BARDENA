\arguments{
\item{data_disease}{Data in data frame or txt format containing patient information (id), Disease codes (Disease_code), Disease codification, and disease date.}

\item{data_drugs}{Data in data frame or txt format containing patient information (id), drug codes (Drug_code), and drug prescription date (Drug_date).}

\item{id}{The name of the column the patients identification codes are found (must be the same column name for "data_diasase" and "data_drugs" data frames.}

\item{deduce_from}{Should de diseases inferred  from clinical history ("from_disease"), from drug prescriptions ("from_drugs"), or from both ("from_Disease&Drugs") .}

\item{Disease_code}{Disease_code refers to the name of the column where the disease codes will be found}

\item{Disease_codification}{column of the data_disease dataframe where the type of codification that "Disease_code" is being codified. Usually this column will contain values such as "ICD9", "ICD10" or "CIAP2" or similar}

\item{Disease_date}{Disease_date refers to the name of the column of the data_disease dataframe  where the date of the coded disease is found}

\item{Disease_group}{Name of the column of the custom disease and/or custom drug  dataframes where DISEASE is found.}

\item{Drug_code}{Name of the column of data_drugs and where the drug codes (usually ATCs)will be found.}

\item{Drug_date}{Name of the column of data_drugs and where the drug prescription dates will be found.}

\item{granularidad}{This boolean parameter defines if mild and severe forms of the disease should be distinguished, and will be applied to liver disease, diabetes and cancer.}

\item{Custom_disease_def}{Data frame with disease groups and disease codes are defined.Disease codes must be the same as the one found in the "data_disease" dataframe.}

\item{Custom_drug_def}{Data frame with disease groups and drug codes are defined.Column names for drug codes must be the same as the one found in the "data_drugs" dataframe.}
}
\value{
Function will return charlson and Elixhauser indexes together with first dates of events if only clinical history is provided. If aditional tables and definitions are provided, first events will be inferred from the provided definitions and patient information.
